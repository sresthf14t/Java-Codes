Arrange The Martix


You are given a 2D matrix with N rows and N coloumns.

In one operation you can swap any two adjecent elements[elements that share a common side].

You have to tell if after any number of operations it is possible to attain such a arrangement of the 
matrix such that the sum of every two adjecent elements is a multiple of 'K'.
If it is possible then print "YES" and then print the arrangement of the Matrix that satisfies 
the given conditions, else print "NO".

1<=N<=1000
1<=arr[i][j]<=1000000000
1<=K<=1000000000

example 

2 4
6 8

here sum of every two adjecent element is a multiple of 2
2+4 is a multiple of 2
2+6 is a multiple of 2
4+2 is a multiple of 2
4+8 is a multiple of 2
6+2 is a multiple of 2
6+8 is a multiple of 2
8+4 is a multiple of 2
8+6 is a multiple of 2


Solution:

By swapping multiple times we can arrive at any permutation of the matrix so the initial arrangement is not important.
We need that sum of every adjecent element is a multiple of K,so first we change all arr[i][j] to arr[i][j]%K.
Then there are two cases when it is possible to find a solution-

1.) All the elements are zero , here any arrangement would work.
2.) If N*N is EVEN then Exactly half of the elements are say 'X' and rest half are (K-X), here if we arrange these two in a chessboard like pattern then  it would work.
	If N*N is ODD then floor(N*N/2) of the elements are say 'X' and rest are (K-X), here if we arrange these two in a chessboard like pattern then  it would work.
