Problem Statement-

You are given a array on length 'N', you are given'Q' queries to perform, You are also given an integer 'K',

1.) Replace all elements form 'L' to 'R' with F(arr[i]), where

F(X) = Factorial(X) mod 10^X.



2.) Output the Number of K's in the range 'L' to 'R'.


Input Format

The first line contains three integers 'N', 'Q' and 'K'.
The next line contains 'N' space seperated integers representing the array.
The next line contains 3 type, L, R integers representing the query type, and the range.

Output Format

For each query of type 2 and 3 output the answer in a new line.

Constraints:

1<=N<=100000
1<=Q<=100000
1<=X<=9
1<=K<=1000000000
1<=arr[i]<=1000000000
1<=L<=R<=N


Editorial:

For the first Query, the function F(X) converges very fast, any number [except 2] will converge 
to 1 in maximum 4 steps, 2 will remaim same after any number of operations.
For this we can use a map to store the indices of all numbers except 1 and 2, for updation we can 
just find all the indices whose elements are not 1,2 and update them ,and if after 
the operation they become 1,2 then we remove the index form the map.

For the Second Query, output can be given using a modified segment tree.
